# Password Generator

## Description
This password generator app is a starter project for learning JavaScript.  It allows for lengths of 8 to 128 characters,
and allows the user to include letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters.  I have ensured
that each category selected will be used in the password at least once.  For the purposes of the assignment, the user
inputs their preferences with a series of pop-ups (prompt and confirm); an obvious next step for the app would be to 
use form elements to provide a nicer means of input.

## Usage
After the user clicks on a button, they are given a series of prompts to answer.  As long as the user enters a valid
password length and selects at least one category of characters, the app will output a password meeting their
requirements.
